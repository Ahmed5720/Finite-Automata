CSC 173 PROJECT BY AHMED NASSAR

NOTE: 
I have made the mistake of not using sets for this project, I have decided instead that creating my own vector dictionary (using a tutorial) would be easier to handle because I am familiar with vectors. ofcourse it didnt turn out to be the case, and I had to create ALOT of my own methods in the vector data structure to mimic that of a HashSET





To compile program, open the source file in terminal then enter the following command

gcc dfa.c nfa.c vec.c main.c -o main.exe
